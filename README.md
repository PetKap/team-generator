# team-generator
App used for randomly shuffling players into teams

1. <i>Random generator</i><br>
User enters all players into a text field, with one player per line, so they are delimited by new line. The players are then shuffled and randomly assigned to teams.
<br>Example:<br>

2. <i>Pair generator</i><br>
User selects how many players are going to play. Next, completes a form by entering player names in pairs. Ensures that players within each pair have similar skill levels. If two players are paired together, they will compete against each other.
<br>Example:<br>

3. <i> Tier generator</i><br>
User selects the number of tiers (s)he wants to use. Then, enters all players into a text field per tier, one player per line (delimited by a new line). The players are then shuffled per tier and randomly assigned to teams (all players from tier1, then tier2 and so on).
<br>Example:<br>

4. <i> Wednesday special</i><br>
It works similar way as tier generator, but it has predefined players in tiers from Wednesday's florbal group.<br>
User enters all players into a text field, with one player per line, so they are delimited by a new line. System will verify whether they are already assigned to tiers or not. For unassigned ones you will need to do it manually. Next the players will be shuffled within each tier and randomly assign to teams (starting with all players from tier 1, then tier 2, and so on).
<br>Example:<br>
