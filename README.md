# team-generator
App used for randomly shuffling players into teams

2. <i>Pair generator</i><br>
User chooses how many players are going to play. Then fills form with player names as pairs. In pair should be players with similar skill level. If they are in pair it means they will play against each other.

3. <i> Tier generator</i><br>
User chooses how many tiers will be used. Then writes all players into textfield per tier. One player per line, so they are delimited by new line. Players are then shuffled per tier and randomly assigned to teams (all players from tier1, then tier2 and so on).
<br>Example:<br>
